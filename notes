"Customer" meeting with Wade
- KYC is required before OFAC
- CIP: Customer Identification Program (for Banks and Fiancial Service companies)
- KYC (3 pieces) vs CIP (4 pieces w/ SSN)
- If we hold deposits for a customer then we need their SSN
- Validate legal name, address,

Originators need KYC and OFAC
Receivers need OFAC checks (think about allowing KYC on them too)

Allow arbitrary map of ID's (salesforceId, etc) to centralize lookups and foreign key relationships

KYC / CIP are 'affirmative' (reasonably sure) whereas OFAC is a negative match (rejection)

Identity Verification of Customer
- Rejected (level 0)
- ReviewRequired (level 1)
- None (level 2)
- OFAC Only (Run check on data I give) (level 3)
- KYC: (3 pieces of info, with workflow that verifies each) (level 4)
  - legal name, address, and date of birth
- CIP: (4 pieces, with SSN) (level 5)
  - pull credit check with SSN (verify DoB, address, etc)
  - required to hold deposits
  - require drivers license

Auth (in Customer model) might not be restricted to one Customer
 - think teller or internal employee

Profile photos (driver license) are hidden to avoid discrimination.

Documents: DriversLicense (Legal name) and Utility Bill (Address)
